    "Convolution is a mathematical operation that involves sliding a small matrix, known as a kernel or filter, across a larger matrix representing the input data, such as an image. During this process, the element-wise product $\\odot$ is computed between the kernel and each local region (sub-matrix) it covers on the input data matrix. The result of this operation is a new matrix, called a feature map, which encodes information about the presence, absence, or strength of specific features in the input data.\n",
