# Convolutional Neural Network Examples

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that demonstrate how to implement convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using Python and popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.

## Contents

- cnn_theory.ipynb: This notebook provides an in-depth overview of the theory behind convolutional neural networks, drawing on concepts from the book "Data Mining and Machine Learning: Fundamental Concepts and Algorithms" by Mohammed J. Zaki and Wagner Meira Jr. It covers topics like convolution, pooling, activation functions, and the architecture of a typical CNN.

- cnn_classification.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to build a CNN for image classification using the MNIST dataset. The notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the code, along with explanations of key concepts.
